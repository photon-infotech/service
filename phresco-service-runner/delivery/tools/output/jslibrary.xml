            <document documentType="DESCRIPTION">
                <content>jQuery is a cross-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
jQuery is free, open source software, dual-licensed under the MIT License[Massachusetts Institute of Technology] or the GNU General Public License, jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, CSS manipulation and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful and dynamic web pages and web applications.

jQuery contains the following features:
1)DOM element selections using the cross-browser open source selector engine Sizzle, a spin-off out of the jQuery project.
2)DOM traversal and modification (including support for CSS 1-3)
3)Events
4)CSS manipulation
5)Effects and animations
6)Ajax
7)Extensibility through plug-ins
8)Utilities - such as user agent information, feature detection
9)Compatibility methods that are natively available in modern browsers but need fallbacks for older ones - For example the inArray() and each()         functions.
10)Cross-browser support

                <content>PlistParser accepts a Property List expressed as an XML string and transforms it into a JavaScript data structure. Structure signifiers (ARRAY, DICT, KEY) in the XML are discarded - their data are returned as JavaScript arrays and associative arrays. Currently the only output option is JSON.PlistParser does not rely on any external libraries like jQuery or JSON. It was written for use within the Appcelerator Titanium environment, but also works with modern browsers. Tested in Titanium, Firefox, IE, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

Other key tools include the ability to turn audio on/off, adjust font size, color, type, line spacing, and background color, as well as the ability to have a backlight and bookmarking capability.The terms iScroller often refers to a person that is using the iScroll application. Similarly the term iScrolling refers to the act of using the iScroll application.iScroll is similar to other electronic book devices such as Amazon Kindle, Sony Reader, and iRex iLiad. However, one does not need to purchase an additional, often bulky device; iScrollers, or people who use the iScroll application, can use their existing smart phones for further convenience and cost savings.</content>
