BDC Meta Man is the first Business Data Catalog tool for all SharePoint Developers and Administrators interested in line of business data integration with SharePoint. Without writing a single line of code you can be viewing and searching across your business data through Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 in minutes.
Business Data Catalog (BDC) allows to integrate business data from external business applications into SharePoint application. BDC has built-in support for displaying data from such data sources as databases and web services. In other words, if the business application is a database or comprises a web service to emit data, its data can be easily incorporated into SharePoint application. If some business application isnâ€™t database and doesnâ€™t have any proper web services, you always can develop your own web service to provide access to the business applicationâ€™s data.

Once the external business application has been registered within Business Data Catalog, its data can be used in Business Data Web Parts, Business Data Column, Search, User profile and other custom solutions.</content>

This is a pretty simple SharePoint 2007 project that can be used to display a popup div at any location on a web part page. It is made up of six parts:
1)An HTML and CSS file to define the contents and design of your popup div
2)A couple of JavaScript files to define the behaviour of the div
3)A web part that renders out the required code to reference the CSS and JavaScript files, and also render out the contents of the HTML file (contained in a Site Collection feature)
4)A list template that provides a basic template to store user preferences associated to the popup div (also contained in a Site Collection feature) - e.g. if the user doesn't want to see the popup again, that preference can be stored in this list
5)The jQuery 1.6.1 library.
6)A web service that enables updating of the user preference via SOAP calls made easy with jQuery (deployed to the /_layouts/ folder)</content>

One useful view of directories and files in a document library is the treeview. If we show other useful information like size and number of files in each directory, it will be more useful for the users.

In this, we will implement a treeview Web Part for the document library. Our intended features of this Web Part are:

1)The tree view will show all files and folders of a document library.
2)The size and number of files in each directory will be shown for users as a tool tip of each directory.
3)User can select and change his target document library in an easy and graphical view.
4)The files and directories will be sorted based on their name.

9)Subsequent upgrades to SharePoint products  and technologies may overwrite  existing Site Definitions. Using Custom Site definition exclude site from potential upgrade issues. 
To avoid Unghosting  , Custom Site Definition is to be create.

Two options to create:-

1)Create New Site Definition File : Either Start from Scratch and create files one by one  or Copy an existing Site Definition and modify it.

2)Copy a Site Definition and change it in Visual Studio:   We can make copy an existing site definition and modify it in visual studio to create new site definition.

The configuration of this site definitions are defined in XML file which is available in

                <content>Soap based web service is a software designed to support interoperable program-to-program interactions over a network. In the context of Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2007, a Web service is a service that returns XML data in response to remote procedure callâ€“type queries. With SharePoint Designer 2007, you can interact with existing Web services by including an XML Web Service data source control on your Web pages. Typically you do this by configuring an XML Web Service as a data source and then by creating Data Views of that data,
Web services are used in a range of application-integration and data-sharing scenarios because they provide interoperability between software components that can reside on different platforms or in different companies. A Web service performs a specific task, in which information is requested by the client computer and returned by the Web service in the form of XML. Some common examples of XML Web services are currency converters, mortgage calculators, and stock quote reports.

XML Web services are made possible by SOAP, a standards-based protocol that is used for exchanging information in XML format over a computer network. Each Web service includes a Web Service Description Language (WSDL) file that contains information about the XML Web service and its capabilities. Web service providers can register their Web services by using Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI), a specification for publishing and locating information about Web services. Interested users can search the UDDI registry for Web services that they might find helpful. After a Web service is added to a Web site, the information about that Web service is displayed by using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</content>

                <content>Tag cloud is merely a collection of terms, typically used as &quot;tags&quot; or &quot;keywords&quot;.  These terms are represented graphically.  Font sizes are increased for popular tags and decreased for less popular tags.  A tag cloud is a &quot;heat map&quot; for keywords, enabling users at a glance to scan a list of terms. Here's the classic example from Flicker:This tag cloud represents the all time most popular tags associated with photos uploaded to Flicker.  From this simple display, you can imply statements like &quot;wedding photos are more popular pictures.
    
Tag clouds are good for discovery in an unbounded set of results. The primary point here is that tag clouds are a great way to depict a large and unpredictable set of tags, terms and topics. However tag clouds are much less suitable when your universe of possible tags is small or finite. If you're dealing with just 10-20 possible tags, do your users a favour and stick with a frequency distribution, histogram or ranked list of categories.
    
Tag clouds should almost always be used as supporting or redundant navigation. Whenever possible I would recommend providing users with a logical, hierarchical browsing structure first, and adding a tag cloud to increase discovery second.  This tag clouds makes a great addition to SharePoint. SharePoint is great at providing highly structured vertical pathing to resources. Adding tag clouds to SharePoint increases discoverability and helps address the chronic problem of finding all of the useful content that gets neatly filed away in your portal.
    
Tag clouds work best on highly dynamic data sets. Tag clouds are most interesting when they change regularly. AJAX enabled tag cloud that updates on the fly would be incredibly great.

The Variations feature uses specific SharePoint timer jobs to perform tasks such as creating and propagating sites and pages. The Variation Timer jobs are bound to each web application which contain a site collection which has the publishing feature enabled.

You can change the Schedule for each job on the Job Definitions page on the Central Administration Web site. The following timer jobs are used to with Variations:
1)The solution provides a simple mechanism for modifying the timer jobs deployed within SharePoint, without needing to redeploy them. 
2)This timer job is responsible to create the variation hierarchy of unspawned labels by creating peers in the new label of sites and pages in the source variation label. By default, this timer job runs once a day.
3)This timer job creates peer sites when the Automatic Creation option has been disabled and a user manually creates a new variation site using Site Manager. By default, this timer job runs every 5 minutes.</content>

ASP.NET developers know it is really easy to create a new user control, drag and drop some controls onto a visual designer, put some logic in the controlâ€™s code-behind, and re-use the control within a single project.  This is because the .ASCX file associated with the control enables you to create markup for your control:
Because you can add markup for your control, you get the nice WYSIWYG designers for your control.  This allows you to drag items from the toolbox, such as a button, a label, and a text box.  
Another nice feature of user controls is that you can quickly add event handlers for your control.  For instance, I double-click the button to add some code-behind, and Visual Studio pops up the code editor to allow me to add some code.
Notice that our code-behind derives from System.Web.UI.UserControl.  For existing ASP.NET developers, you will be happy to see that itâ€™s the same old UserControl class thatâ€™s been there since ASP.NET was introduced.  By using the .ASCX, Visual Studio 2007 provides the same WYSIWYG, drag-and-drop features that you have with ASP.NET development.  In your SharePoint 2007 project, add a new User Control to your project, add the markup to the .ASCX file, and put some code in the code-behind. </content>

Since the web part connects to an external RSS feed, it needs to be deployed to the Global Assemby Cache (GAC) for security reasons.

                <content>Wiki creation is a site that is designed for groups of people to quickly capture and share ideas by creating simple pages and linking them together. After someone creates a page, another team member can add more content, edit the content, or add supporting links. The community of authors helps to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the content. Wikis continue to evolve as people add and revise information.
